### *Just a list of tools used by me*

## [AutoJump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)
This is a self-learning directory changer for navigating your filesystem. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line.

## [Atom](http://atom.io/)
Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.
